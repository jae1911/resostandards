# Resostandards

This repository contains a collection of proposed community standards around the platform Resonite.

## Why

As you may have noticed with some systems (for instance, audio reactivity), there are a ton of personal standards instead of a large one agreed by the community.  
Such universal standards would be preferable as it would also more interoperability between systems, allow for easier implementation and leave users with easier choices to disable such systems.

## Subjects

- Wiki - Standard formatting for certain wiki pages
